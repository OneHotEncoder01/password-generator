# password-generator
main_password_genarater.py is a terminal applicatin that works in linux distros.
there are two options after execute the main_password_genarater.py on terminal.
user can chose a password that generated from random letters(upper,lower inclusiv) and numbers.  Second option is 
random english words and number which is stronger than first option. The only problem with the second option is 
its usually longer compared to the first option which makes it harder to memorize for non english speakers.
I am a high scholler who tries to learn coding so comments are more than welcomed.(this generator is amateurly made)
